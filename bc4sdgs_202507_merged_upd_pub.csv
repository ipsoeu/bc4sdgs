PSTW-684,1,iVoting - a cyberdemocracy tool,ùhttps://ivoting.pl/en/,"iVoting is a tool that allows local governments to organize surveys and polls as well as to conduct voting on civic budgets via the Internet. Thanks to iVoting, it is possible to create the electronic identity of citizens using advanced cryptology and blockchain. Municipal or municipal applications based on iVoting can be used by citizens to authenticate their computers and smartphones on several levels of security. IVoting protocols guarantee transparency and audibility of the voting procedure. Thanks to the applied cybernetics and cryptology, votes can be anonymous (secret) and public, depending on the type of vote. The system provides a strong level of security thanks to the use of a decentralized network of notaries' servers, which creates a trust machine that makes it virtually impossible to manipulate voting results. The application can be used for modern communication with feedback directly between the citizen and the local government administration. iVoting is great for use in local participatory budgets, local public opinion polling, electronic referenda or plebiscites, creating polls and public opinion polling, it can also be used for voting in various collegial bodies such as sessions, councils and local government committees. As the only tool in Poland, it will support the statutory local resolution initiatives and the collection of signatures for petitions and civic applications to local governments.

This register must then be made accessible so that it can be consulted for any doubts in distinguishing real images from falsified images. The TrueBees project was among the winners (fifteen selected out of 90 applications from all over Europe) of the call launched by Trublo. Trublo is part of the European NGI (Next Generation Internet) initiative, funded under the Horizon 2020 program, to promote studies on how new technologies, and in particular blockchain, can revolutionize the media sector. Trublo supports the launch of industry research projects for the development of new software, platforms or tools. The term blockchain technologies indicates a set of traceability techniques that allow to retrace and reconstruct the processing chain, the life cycle of the multimedia data, through the traces left by the acquisition system, the encoding and re-encoding of the signal, but also to shed light on provenance, manipulation and sharing on social networks.

The core value-added of the blockchain-based system is the enhanced targeting of public money thanks to programmable money flows. Detailed spending conditions and eligibility criteria are programmed in the smart contract. Possible criteria include: detailed profiles of the beneficiaries and authorized providers, financial thresholds or usage limits.

According to RvIG, a reliable, easy-to-use digital identity is a prerequisite for being able to participate in the blockchain. There are still many questions open about the concept of digital identity. RvIG recently organized an internal blockchain workshop. One of the most appealing examples of 'identity in the blockchain' that came up was the do-it-yourself marriage. For the conclusion of a marriage, three parties are now needed: the two partners who decide to marry and the registrar of the civil registry who closes the marriage. The civil registrar's role is that of the 'third party that creates trust and can conclude the agreement after checking.' The nature of the blockchain means that this 'third party' is in some cases superfluous. In theory, this could also apply to a marriage: via the blockchain, the identity and intention of the two partners can be checked and verified via smart contracts and the decentralized databases.

The blockchain network was jointly developed by IBM and the National Council of Clerks (NCC). The blockchain platform is built on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and aims to increase transparency and efficiency in legal transactions associated with the lifecycle of companies in the registry. Specifically, the solution will be used to record and share data related to the exchanges of regulatory information related to companies' difficulties, as well as the changes of status of the company registered on the French territory. That includes such data as change of corporate name, registration court office, establishment of branch offices, and business dissolution.

The prototype was developed jointly with several large pension providers and a team of platform developers at APG, under the name Hyfen. You can use this platform to transfer pensions rights much more quickly and simply Ã¢ÂÂ and safely. This application searches for pensions for you and immediately gives you the option of looking at a proposal for transferring the value. All the main elements are covered in the proposal, letting you make a proper comparison between the two pensions arrangements. The platform has been developed with a modular structure that allows the administrative systems of pensions sector parties to be connected together. After a technology assessment was carried out, a combination of proven technology (such as databases and cloud infrastructure) combined with distributed ledger technology (DLT) was chosen for implementing the pension rights transfer platform. DLT is essentially a kind of records system that the information can be stored in.

PSTW-840,148,Self Sovereign Attendancy,https://northsearegion.eu/media/16508/pilot-story-blockchainlab-drenthe-3.pdf,"At many conferences, events and classes, attendees are required to sign in via some form of attendance list. They often end up putting their name and signature on a public list, which many people can see or access. The typical registration sheet - usually a paper list open for everybody to see, is outdated and is often not GDPR compliant, as anybody with access to the list can copy the information on it. If any of the organizations involved had an incentive to manipulate the attendance numbers, a paper attendee list is very susceptible to fraud. Blockchain technology can offer a solution to this problem with the development of the Self Sovereign Attendance App. With this app, based on IOTA, people can check in on a decentralized blockchain, which is immutable, transparent and cryptographically protected, so that only the authorized parties can access and see attendee data. The proof of concept was successful, and BlockchainLab is continuing to develop the pilot building prototypes for the production app. With this solution, it has been shown how a blockchain-enabled solution can improve the safety, trust and fairness for different groups of users and organisations.

PSTW-850,158,Cross-border micro-credentials,https://walt.id/case-studies/tampere-ktu,"Universities do not have digital records for students especially for courses obtained across borders. This means that a large amount of manual work is needed. Tampere University in Finland & Kaunas University of Technology in Lithuania, are part of the university network ECIU, however, student accreditation such as micro-credentials from courses (i.e. micro-modules or ECIU challenges) are not transferable between the two universities, making it very hard for students to take necessary courses abroad. Additionally, the current course accreditation system is missing any records of skills and/or achievements acquired by the students. Both universities are taking leading positions towards building micro-accreditations standards. With such semantic models, universities across the EU could easily and in the uniform manner exchange academic information. Although, even having agreed a common data model there is still a need for a network or infrastructure that would allow the delivery of credentials that everyone can trust by default and be certain that they are authentic and legally binding. Moreover, such data transfer should address GDPR and EIDAS requirements, and students need to have mobility and interoperability. That is how it was decided to participate in the E BSI Early adopters Multi-university pilot. EBSI not only provides a trusted network by using blockchain technology, but ensures GDPR and EIDAS compliance and has a governance framework agreed between all Member States that ensures trust and reliability. The project team decided to use Ã¢ÂÂSelf Sovereign IdentityÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂSSIÃ¢ÂÂ to create transferable and verifiable micro credentials for students of both universities.

PSTW-1310,162,Participa.gov Ã¢ÂÂ Digital Public Participation Platform,https://participa.gov.pt/,"Instruments for public participation make it possible to encourage collaborative discussion between decision-makers and stakeholders, creating the ideal environment for obtaining more thoughtful and equitable decisions, avoiding institutional suspicion, increasing the likelihood of consensus, and consequently increasing the success of the policies themselves. During the 2019 Simplex program, a national flagship initiative based on citizen engagement and co-creation for the simplification and modernization of the public sector, the idea came up and AMA delivered.

Participa.GOV is exactly that Ã¢ÂÂ a one-stop-shop platform where citizens can present their proposals and decide through their votes on all relevant initiatives for their lives Ã¢ÂÂ From the national budget to a GovTech contest or their childrenÃ¢ÂÂs school initiatives, everything is possible at Participa.gov. Simply put, public entities launch a challenge, based on a set of rules predefined at the back office, and citizens present their proposals and then decide through their voting. A school might want its students to vote on the launch a social responsibility project, or the central government might launch a national participatory budgeting, or we can even have the NHS wanting to launch a restricted and exclusive participatory, process, available only to its workers Ã¢ÂÂ all of it is possible and works under the same rules. And better yet? The look and feel of the front office will always be the same.

When developing participa.gov we took into account two major factors:

1. The need to be customizable, because each entity has its own idiosyncrasies and target audiences and because each initiative is different.
2. The need to be safe, secure, and transparent because we know that the biggest challenge of any participatory system is related to trust factors.

The Participa.gov platform was therefore built using highly secure eID mechanisms and blockchain technology, ensuring security, auditing, and transparency in the process from start to finish. Because data is protected by cryptography and thus immutable, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies make it possible to overcome corruption and ensure there is no intervention from malicious outside players. Secure digital identity mechanisms add an extra layer of security and, in the case of the Portuguese eID ecosystem, it allows the participants' scope to be defined based on the attributes available in the Portuguese digital identity: age, address, professional attributes, and so on.

The Participa.gov portal was created with the belief that digital technologies, when combined with public participation tools, can play an important role in connecting citizens to democracy. And, in this new era of digital democracy, we want Participa.gov to become the single national platform for all public participatory processes, involving more citizens in public decision-making every

PSTW-1375,170,Licence to practice,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Licence+to+practice,"In Cyprus and around Europe, for many types of studies (e.g., Engineering, medical studies, etc.) it is required that University graduates are in possession of a license or certificate to practice, issued by a competent National professional authority, so that they can legally embark on their professional career of choice. At the same time, many Cypriot students are studying abroad which often requires cross-border issuance and verification of credentials. Greece is the second most popular academic destination for Cyprus students, with a share in the region of 30% Cypriot graduates. The current process to issue a licence to practice is mostly manual. This results in several challenges such as time delays (it takes a minimum of three months to have a licence to practice issued), considerable administrative costs, as well as vulnerability to human errors and fraud. This has a negative impact on its reliability, and an adverse effect on the level of stakeholders' trust to the current process. The Greek Universities network (GUnet), the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy of Cyprus and ETEK are addressing these challenges by allowing the issuance, sharing and verification of education credentials (and more specifically, licence to practice credential) across borders by using the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure

PSTW-1635,182,ACCUDIRE - export tracking based on blockchain,https://accudire.eu/,"The DLT use case was conducted in July 2021 and presented two months later in Trieste during the conference ""Italy Smart Export"". The ""Pilot 1.0"" was a shipment from Italy to Turkey with a complete digitisation of the logistics documentation and interoperability between public and private subjects involved. It was the first fully digital shipment exploiting blockchain technology in Italy and Europe and it involved the following players: Benetton Group (exporting company), Port of Trieste (customs and place of departure for the Ro-Ro shipment), ADM (the Italian Customs Agency which gave a quality check about the correctness of the process), a global freight forwarder and a Turkish Import Company. The shipment has been done using the ACCUDIRE platform and creating an e-CMR (Electronic Consignment Note for road transportation). The identities of the subjects involved have been verified through two-factor authentication and their signatures have been geolocated and saved on blockchain, interoperating with AIDA (ADM's software) and sending the pre-arrival notification of goods to the PCS (Port Community Systems). Specifically, the e-CMR document needs 3 signatures (sender, carrier and receiver) and ACCUDIRE saves on blockchain these signatures (including geolocation, identity and all other relevant information) in order to guarantee immutability, traceability and security of the shipping related information. Blockchain used is a permissioned Hyper Ledger Fabric supplied by TrustedChain with nodes all in Italy at AgID (Agency for Digital Italy) qualified entities (Trust Service Providers, according to the eIDAS-regulation).

The pilot has been inserted also as a use case of the DTLF and mentioned in the Subgroup 1 (Paperless Transport) of the e-FTI (Electronic Freight Transport Information) discussions, which is regularising and formalising digital processes related to the transport of goods across Europe. Additionally, ACCUDIRE is part of the European Horizon 2020 TRICK project, which aims at supporting SMEs operating in fashion and food industries in the adoption, tracing and demonstration of sustainable approaches by means of Blockchain.

The impact of the use case has been relevant for Italy and Europe. The pilot represents the first shipment with fully digitised documents and processes with blockchain, simplifying all the procedures and especially the interoperability between public and private players involved. ACCUDIRE is now an innovative platform that allows Large and SMEs involved in global supply chains in the complete digitisation of processes and documentation through a paperless and eco-friendly approach, preserving ""Made in"" and protecting products against counterfeiting. Thanks to ACCUDIRE, companies can reduce costs, maximise margins, decrease waste and work in synergy with the many other actors involved along the chain. In addition, ACCUDIRE allows a better connection between trade and trade finance, simplifying the flow of financial information and thus the payment of the goods and the dialogue between banks and

PSTW-1638,185,Green Blockchain,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/European+Blockchain+Sandbox+announces+the+selected+projects+for+the+first+cohort#EuropeanBlockchainSandboxannouncestheselectedprojectsforthefirstcohort-ACCUDIRE,"The Green Blockchain combines GreenTech and Tech4Green to notarise the treatment of climatic data from low-cost sensors deployed in urban areas. We focus on the issue of digital frugality, in the context of the environmental objectives of the Paris Agreement and the European infrastructure for the observation of the carbon cycle, called ICOS.

Our use case consists of a blockchain-based tool for collecting, processing and displaying CO2 concentrations from sensors deployed in urban areas. A network of sensors collects raw climatic data and sends it to a laboratory (typically one for each urban area) that treats this data in order to arrive at a temporal series of CO2 concentrations for each sensor. The treated data is then made public through a web dashboard, and the treatment process is notarised via calls to smart contracts on the blockchain. Our tool relies on non-energy consuming technologies such as proof-of-stake and Byzantine fault tolerance, which can reduce the consumption of traditional blockchains (i.e., those based on proof-of-work) by three orders of magnitude.

Notarisation is done by anchoring (i.e., storing the hashes of data on the blockchain to ensure data's integrity). The anchoring allows the laboratories (or other third parties) to audit each other by reproducing the treatment process and checking data's integrity against the hashes stored on the blockchain. The ultimate goal is to provide trust on the climatic data and its treatment to the public.

Essentially, the Green Blockchain adds new trusted services that enable European environmental players (whether institutional or industrial) to interact with each other without any central control

Chunk Works software offers easy-to-use, quantum-secure hybrid encryption and autonomous data recovery built on in-house-developed distributed ledger technology.

Chunk Works combines the convenience of multi-system operability with quantum-secure hybrid encryption. It prioritizes privacy and security without sacrificing performance and can be deployed on any infrastructure (cloud, on-premise, devices, etc.). Under the hood, data storage and retrieval are made more reliable by automatically distributing data across locations. With its autonomous data recovery system, users can be confident that their data is available to them when they need it.


Chunk WorksÃ¢ÂÂ software safely stores your data using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and Erasure Coding (EC). EC protects data by breaking it up into pieces called chunks, encoding them with redundant data, and storing them in a number of different locations via DLT. In case any of the chunks later get lost, damaged, or can't otherwise be downloaded, the added redundant data can recreate the file.

Alta Novella had belonged to Borgo dÃ¢ÂÂAnaunia Municipality since the 1960s, but then it was abandoned because of the absence of a dam. When production is low, running and maintaining a hydropower plant becomes an expensive burden. Indeed, the main motivation for setting up a data center at the municipal hydropower plant was economic. The municipality doesnÃ¢ÂÂt actually mine or trade bitcoin. Alps Blockchain, the Italian tech company that set up the mining farm at Alta Novella and carries out maintenance, simply purchases the computing power produced by the facilityÃ¢ÂÂs mining farm for at least 35% more than what the government pays for its energy. Alps Blockchain sells the computing power purchased from the facility to bitcoin mining pools around the world. Alta Novella is one of 18 hydropower plants in northern Italy that now house a mining farm set up by Alps Blockchain. The company aims to double that number by the end of the year.

Available on GitHub, the sandbox is designed to offer an interface for interacting with the test network, enabling functions like minting, burning and transferring ERC-20 tokens, the Norges BankÃ¢ÂÂs official CBDC partner Nahmii said in a blog post.  Nahmii stressed that the current version of the code does not support the major Ethereum wallet MetaMask by design and is only privately accessible by users with appropriate credentials. In addition to deploying the appropriate smart contracts and access controls, the Norges Bank sandbox includes a custom frontend and network monitoring tools like BlockScout and Grafana. The front end also shows a filterable summary of transactions on the network, Nahmii noted.  The Norges Bank mentioned that NorwayÃ¢ÂÂs CBDC prototype infrastructure is based on Ethereum technology. The central bank previously made a reference to Ethereum in a CBDC-related blog post in May. The Norges Bank stated that the Ethereum cryptocurrency system is expected to provide a Ã¢ÂÂcore infrastructureÃ¢ÂÂ for issuance, distribution and destruction of digital central bank money, which is also referred to as DSP.

All regulated products will have DPPs. This will ensure that supply chains become more circular and that consumers are aware of the environmental impacts of their purchases.

EUÃ¢ÂÂs Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation as well as the Battery Regulation, have outlined the adoption of DPPs with the aim to make durable and repairable products Ã¢ÂÂthe normÃ¢ÂÂ in the EUÃ¢ÂÂs single market.

For DPPs to succeed, third-party verification of data is key to ensure transparency across a wide range of materials and products. This regulatory framework presents big opportunities for the introduction of blockchain-related technologies that ensure a chain of trust across supply chains in Europe and beyond. As a member of the Product Circularity Data Sheets (PCDS) Initiative which is led by the Ministry of Economy of Luxembourg and supported by major international industry leaders, Compellio has taken concrete steps to contribute to EuropeÃ¢ÂÂs Green & Digital transition by developing a new Digital Product Passport solution for the Circular Economy that enables out-of-the-box compliance with the upcoming ISO 59040 PCDS standard.
Moreover, the European Commission has selected CompellioÃ¢ÂÂs collaborative project with Uni Systems, as part of the first 20 use cases of the EU Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox. This milestone decision underscores the significance of the European effort in advancing blockchain technology, and Digital Product Passports (DPPs) on a grand scale.

Despite the fact that there are currently several solutions that partially respond to these needs, there is a lack of integration between them, a problem that this project seeks to solve. Blockchain technology, in addition to allowing the creation of a single standard for the different actors in the system, also guarantees data's security and transparency. Additionally, Zero Knowledge Proof techniques allow final emissions to be quantified, without having to reveal details of the production process that generated them, thus obtaining a reliable and at the same time confidential system for all parties involved. The working group, which brings together the entities with a main role in the initiative, is led by CBCat (Centre Blockchain de Catalunya), which has the role of providing the design of the blockchain platform that will support the entire system.

This blockchain use case, developed in research project Vidameco, demonstrates an integrated hardware and software solution for standardized data collection and tamperproofing using microservices and blockchain. Vidameco can be used to enable standardization and data integrity for a variety of use cases. In more traditional sectors such as shipping this can drive digitalization. Focusing on EUÃ¢ÂÂs Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) regulations, implementing the Vidameco approach, can reduce redundancy in data collection and quick verification of both, the data used as input to the value chain and the certification produced at the end, ensuring traceability from the former to the latter.

PSTW-1953,218,Equilibrium Group: Tokenizing real-world assets,https://www.eqg.co/news/eqg-to-the-european-blockchain-regulatory-sandbox,"Equilibrium Group builds decentralized solutions aiming to tokenize various real-world assets and enable them to operate on DLT/blockchain systems. Equilibrium group has been selected as one of the use cases for the inaugural cohort of the European Blockchain Sandbox. Through Membrane Finance, Equilibrium Group has tokenized the euro fiat currency by creating a fully regulated e-money version called EUROe. EUROe can be used for any payment on blockchain networks.

EUROe is an EU-based stablecoin and payment network regulated as an electronic money institution in the European Union. Based in Finland, as an European hub for technology & regulatory stability.

Moreover, Equilibrium Group is exploring the regulatory environment for tokenizing shares of unlisted companies, which would allow companies to use DLT-based technologies to maintain their share registries. DLT-based technologies already constitute the cheapest and fastest way to issue, maintain and use digital assets, driving efficiency gains. Furthermore, DLT-based technologies are inherently standardized, allowing issued assets to smoothly interoperate with other services deployed on the platform, with minimal integration related overhead.

Additionally, Equilibrium Group will explore the tokenization of other real-world assets and the creation of a DLT-based regulated marketplace, which entails personal data processing and would require novel digital identity solutions (e.g., zero-knowledge proof-based KYC). This work may lead to a new RWA token standard.

However, the regulatory framework/landscape regarding the tokenization of real world assets in the EU is still unclear and without many precedents. Also, once a tokenized asset has been created, there are regulatory uncertainties as to where this asset can be transacted with and what are the rights and/or obligations for all relevant parties.

PSTW-1955,220,Open Customs Blockchain,https://openlogisticsfoundation.org/open-customs-blockchain-selected-in-the-first-cohort-of-use-cases-for-the-european-blockchain-sandbox/,"Open Customs Blockchain introduces Europeanmade, open source blockchain software into logistics and customs processing to simplify data exchange and increase transparency in crossborder supply chains. It aims to speed up border processes, decrease transit times, reduce the need for physical inspections at the border and finally make international trade more sustainable by replacing current paper-based documentation with a more efficient, trustworthy technology: Blockchain.

Customs information Ã¢ÂÂ based on the original invoice data (Goods Passport ID Project) and the export accompanying document (EAD) as exemplified by the project BORDER Ã¢ÂÂ is stored in a tamper-proof way and distributed along the supply chain. Together, the two sub-projects form the framework of the Open Customs Blockchain. As the customs-related information is required repeatedly in various steps of an export or import process by several parties, blockchain increases transparency and trust by making data origins consistently traceable. Moreover, Open Customs has been included in the European Blockchain Sandbox by the EU. The project is initiated and supported by the Open Logistics Foundation and its Working Group Open Customs Blockchain. It consists of major logistics companies Rhenus, DHL and DACHSER, as well as customs and IT service providers ALS, AEB, IP Customs Solutions and leading logistics research institution Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and Logistics.
A practical test of the first software components in a blockchain test network is currently being prepared.

The project, which is funded by Next Generation European funds, is executed by the Rovira i Virgili University (URV), official bidder and coordinator of the initiative; the University of Barcelona (UB); the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB); the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC); and the University of Girona (UdG). In addition, the University of Lleida (UdL), the Open University of Catalonia (UOC) and the Consortium of University Services of Catalonia (CSUC) will act as observers of the process.

In this context, the development of the blockchain platform was awarded to the Digital Transformation division of Seidor, and to the electronic signature, verifiable credentials and digital identity company Validated ID.

Both companies will be responsible for creating the system through which universities can digitally exchange student data in an agile and secure manner, under the framework of the European infrastructure EBSI (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure). Thus, the credentials can be validated in any country of the European Union (EU) through interoperable and scalable services.

Likewise, CAMINS will encourage students to be owners of their data, through a digital wallet that will be linked to a recognized digital identity.

PSTW-1958,223,Historical heritage protection,https://www.eldiadecordoba.es/cordoba/Ayuntamiento-Cordoba-protegera-patrimonio-historico-artistico_0_1799520532.html,"CÃÂ³rdoba City Council will complete a process to protect its historical-artistic heritage against fraud, forgery and theft. This process will begin with an ""initial audit to evaluate the heritage assets to determine their location, typology, state of conservation, mobility and any relevant report on the asset."" Subsequently, after completing the audit, a certification of ownership and authorship of these assets will be carried out, incorporating systems to protect them, such as blockchain technology; or what is the same, ""a built-in geolocation chip to prevent theft, fraud and forgery.""

The project was launched as a pilot in the Julio Romero de Torres Museum in 2021 and will now be extended to more assets of the municipal Heritage after the granting, by the Ministry of Territorial Policy, of 1.19 million euros from the Next funds Generation to the City Council of Cordoba for four projects linked to digitalization and cybersecurity.

This certification is necessary, according to the project report, because ""there is no tool that allows quick uploading and access to the ownership data of a certified asset on a technological platform that also complies with a set of anti-fraud measures."" and allows you to extract collective and individualized statistics and metrics from the assets.""

The document emphasizes that blockchain technology could revolutionize the art industry, ""resolving issues such as provenance, copyright, ownership of the work, its traceability and other current problems."" All of this in a context in which in the art and heritage market, great challenges are detected to be resolved, such as avoiding fraud, ""ensuring the authorship and origin of the art works"" .

The objective is to certify and protect all the authenticity of the heritage through blockchain technology, which is unhackable and secure. 

The first step to carry out the project is to work with the museum management to identify all the heritage archives that can be stored in blockchain, to which a label will be incorporated to make a secure documentary trace and we will now add sensors, which have two functions: geolocation and an accelerometer. With all this, it will be known, for example, if someone steals a painting, because it will be alerted about the location of each work of art from Cordoba's heritage in real time, with a maximum of about 2,000 pieces.

With this test, the Spanish stock market manager has developed a solution that allows tokenization and smart contracts through Ethereum technology, in order to facilitate investment.

However, BME has identified certain limitations in the current regulations, such as, for example, that it does not allow the exchange of tokens in a secondary market, a situation that should have been solved with the launch of the DLT pilot regime of the European Commission and the new Spanish Securities Market Law.

Blockchain technology allows to offer a primary token issuance market with legal certainty. Thanks to the project, important efficiencies can be achieved throughout the entire life cycle of a digital asset in its issuance, distribution, settlement and registration functions.

PSTW-1960,225,"CircularTrust, waste management system",https://circulartrust.eu/,"Minsait and Ecoembes have opted for blockchain technology to optimize their waste management systems. The objective of the Circular Trust project is to increase the transparency and reduce the costs of the recycling process while minimizing the environmental impact.

All players who participate in one way or another in the recycling process will be able to access the system data and improve information transactions. Thus, public administrations, local entities, operators, recyclers and other organizations will have quality information on real-time monitoring of waste selection, collection and recycling.

Proposals like this are now key in the strategies of companies and public administrations, even more so taking into account that around 2.5 billion tons of waste are generated annually in the EU, which requires adequate management to reduce its impact on the environment. Since CircularTrust began operating in 2020, hundreds of daily transactions have been recorded associated with the removal of waste in more than 90 sorting plants in Spain, as well as the transfer of waste to more than 70 approved recycling facilities, with monitoring. of the entire process in real time. During the first half of 2022, an average of 4,725 withdrawals and around 18,000 monthly transactions have been processed, which have been immutably recorded in the blockchain network.

As this project demonstrates, blockchain offers the possibility of continuing to take steps to improve the recycling process, offering greater control of information thanks to the establishment of smart contracts, the generation of documentary evidence or automation or payments, among others. . In this way, this technology not only results in greater transparency, but also in greater efficiency.

PSTW-1969,234,Cross-border cross-university micro-credentials in Europe,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSI/Micro+-+Credentials,"A consortium led by 4 universities, 4 IT solutions providers and a research centre - from France, Spain, and Romania are pioneering the future of micro-credentials in Europe by developing a presentation and verification platform using eDiplomas to achieve cross-university education mobility to facilitate the cross-border issuance, recognition, and acceptance of educational digital certificates. A challenge facing the current education system is its tendency to overlook the diverse achievements of learners, particularly when it comes to micro-credentials. Despite learners demonstrating a range of valuable skills and interests by completing courses, programmes or trainings, their accomplishments are often unnoticed. This lack of recognition not only hampers learners' ability to showcase their competencies but also limits their opportunities for admission to relevant programs, especially within the framework of European mobility. Micro-credentials, owned by the learner, provide a unique opportunity for individuals to showcase their skills in a portable and shareable format. Whether as standalone achievements or combined into comprehensive bundles, micro-credentials offer a dynamic representation of an individual's capabilities.  When leveraging EBSI, this opportunity transforms into a powerful catalyst for recognising and valuing individual achievements. It will allow life-long learners to ensure that their educational- and professional-gained skills, represented as micro-credentials, can be shared and recognised across borders and institutions. A team of education ministries and universities across Europe envision this project as a way to reshape the learning environment in Europe and demonstrate how learners can benefit from micro-credentials.

PSTW-1971,236,Vocational Education & Training,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSI/Vocational+Education+and+Training,"A consortium of Government ministries, federal and research institutes, public companies, and universities are pioneering the future of vocational education and training in Europe with EBSI by facilitating the issuance, acceptance, and recognition of all types of vocational educational and training certifications across borders.  Vocational education and training (VET) systems in Europe are not centrally governed but rather rely on a well-developed network of VET stakeholders. The social partners that govern these networks are employers and trade unions, structured as chambers, committees, and councils.

However, the way these social partners communicate and exchange information in Europe still faces challenges at administrative and regulatory levels, especially with the issuance, acceptance, and verification of paper or digital vocational education credentials. This is because vocational education qualifications in Europe lack administrative processes and regulatory implementation - including the use of standardised data models. This gap affects all levels of the process, resulting in a high number of steps, prolonged timeframes, shared and ambiguous responsibilities, or a reliance on intermediary third parties. Web3 allows a streamlined digital verification process for learners' affiliations and credentials without a reliance on intermediaries, helping the Europe wide VET system strengthen the acceptance and popularity of vocational verifiable credentials while upholding user information privacy. This is specifically relevant when employers (verifiers) require professional and specific skills from the applicants: a reliable authentication process for vocational skillsets opens up novel career paths for the European vocational workforce.

HR departments can either trust the authenticity of the documents or dedicate time and effort to phone back previous employers for verification.

PSTW-2040,239,Swarmchestrate - Application-level Swarm-based Orchestration Across the Cloud-to-Edge Continuum,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135012,"Collecting and analysing large amounts of data in the Cloud-to-Edge computing continuum raises novel challenges. Processing all this data centrally in cloud data centres is not feasible anymore as transferring large amounts of data to the cloud is time-consuming, expensive, degrade performance and may raise security concerns. Therefore, novel distributed computing paradigms, such as edge and fog computing emerged to support processing data closer to its origin. Application microservices are managed in a dynamic Orchestration Space by decentralised Orchestration Agents, governed by distributed intelligence that provides matchmaking between application requirements and resources, and supports the dynamic self-organisation of Swarms. Knowledge and trust, essential for the operation of the Orchestration Space, will be managed through blockchain-based trusted solutions using methods of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and Distributed Identifiers (DID). End-to-end security of the overall system will be assured by utilising state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms and privacy preserving data analytics.

The solution is based on a decentralised system that encourages residents and tourists to visit the least-visited areas by using blockchain and smart contracts. The system works by employing oracles (a service by which a blockchain or smart contract feeds on external data outside the blockchain on which it runs) to obtain information from the Consell de FormenteraÃ¢ÂÂs Tourism Intelligence System (TIS), where the pilot project is being carried out, and rolled out over the Alastria Network.

PSTW-2114,248,Web3 Quadratic Funding for Public Infrastructure,https://daotimes.com/this-city-pilots-web3-quadratic-funding-for-public-infrastructure/,"The city of Split, Croatia is piloting an innovative new system for deciding how to fund municipal infrastructure projects. Called ""quadratic funding,"" the mechanism aims to fairly account for both public and private preferences when allocating limited budget resources. A coalition of organisations including BlockSplit, Funding the Commons, Gitcoin, and the City of Split launched the Municipal Quadratic Funding Initiative in September 2023. The project goals include implementing quadratic funding for prioritizing public spending, utilizing web3 tools to increase transparency and participation, and demonstrating the potential of these technologies to improve legacy processes. The partners believe that the transparency and configurability of blockchain systems make them well-suited to quadratic funding applications. Quadratic funding mathematically accounts for the intensity of demand for public goods. Groups can create projects which individuals can support financially. The amount of money ultimately directed to each proposal is based on the square of support received. This means that projects attracting larger numbers of smaller contributions can compete with those receiving fewer large donations. In this way, quadratic funding aims to reflect both willingness to pay and breadth of support in funding decisions. It attempts to break tendency towards corruption where influential groups lobby for their niche interests. The goal is a fairer allocation suited to the whole community's preferences. The initiative will build on open source quadratic funding infrastructure already deployed for other uses like funding public goods on Ethereum. Practical web3 tools can help teadministration manage funding rounds and disburse awards.  A small experiment funding neighborhood improvements in Croatia's second largest city may pioneer a better way to budget public money. The Municipal Quadratic Funding Initiativecombine modern cryptography with an innovation in mechanism design to surface fairer collective preferences.

The whole of Estonia relies on the information provided by the National Gazette. There is no paper copy to turn to if something is wrong in the portal. To protect such an important database, Centre of Registers and Information Systems (RIK) uses various security measures, one of them being blockchain. Blockchain technology is used as one layer in securing the information against unauthorised changes. By integrating the hash values of laws and regulations published in xml format together with the hash values of the digitally signed version into a cryptographic chain, they have created the means to regularly validate all the information published on the portal. In the case of unauthorised changes to the information, they would be notified immediately and could take action. Therefore, blockchain technology can not only be used as a way to add trust to the information, but also as a simple mechanism to regularly verify and be aware of the truthfulness of that information.",National,Estonia,EE,Centre of Registers and Information Systems (RIK),Central-Government,General public services,,Implemented,2010,,Enforcement,Certification and validation processes,No,No,Blockchain,,G2G,,,,,,,x,,,,x,x,x,,,,,,https://e-estonia.com/blockchain-security-control-for-government-registers/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23/05/2024,1,,1,1,(1) No direct impact on poverty reduction.,"(1) The initiative does not directly address poverty alleviation or economic inequality, focusing instead on information security and transparency.",(1) No direct impact on poverty reduction.,1,,1,1,(1) Doesn't address hunger or nutrition directly.,"(1) There is no direct impact on hunger or food security, as the initiative is centered around legal and regulatory information.",(1) Initiative doesn't address hunger or nutrition.,1,,1,1,(1) No significant contribution to health and wellbeing.,(1) Health and well-being are not directly influenced by the publication of laws and regulations in a secure digital format.,(1) No significant contribution to health and wellbeing.,2,,1,1,(2) Supports education through secure access to information.,"(1) The initiative does not contribute to education or learning opportunities, as it is focused on legal information dissemination.",(1) Doesn't directly impact education or learning.,1,,1,1,(1) No specific focus on gender equality.,(1) Gender equality is not specifically addressed or impacted by the secure publication of laws and regulations.,(1) No focus on gender equality or empowerment.,1,,1,1,(1) Doesn't directly address clean water and sanitation.,"(1) The initiative does not relate to water management or sanitation issues, focusing instead on digital information security.",(1) Clean water and sanitation not addressed.,1,,1,1,(1) No direct impact on affordable and clean energy.,"(1) Energy access and sustainability are not relevant to the initiative, which is about securing legal information.",(1) No direct relation to affordable and clean energy.,1,,1,1,(1) Doesn't contribute to decent work and economic growth.,"(1) The initiative does not directly promote economic growth or employment, as it is focused on legal information security.",(1) Doesn't contribute to decent work or economic growth.,1,,9,1,(1) No significant impact on industry and infrastructure.,(9) The initiative significantly contributes to building resilient infrastructure and fostering innovation through the use of blockchain for secure information management.,(1) No significant impact on industry or infrastructure.,1,,1,8,(1) Doesn't address inequalities or reduce disparities.,"(1) The initiative does not address inequality within or among countries, focusing on national legal information security.",(8) Reduces inequality by ensuring equal access to information.,1,,1,1,(1) No direct impact on sustainable cities and communities.,"(1) Sustainable cities and communities are not directly impacted by the initiative, which is about digital information security.",(1) Doesn't directly impact sustainable cities or communities.,1,,1,1,(1) Doesn't contribute to responsible consumption and production.,"(1) The initiative does not relate to responsible consumption or production patterns, focusing on legal information security.",(1) No focus on responsible consumption or production.,1,,1,1,(1) No significant impact on climate action.,"(1) Climate action is not addressed by the initiative, which is centered on securing legal information.",(1) Doesn't address climate action or environmental protection.,1,,1,1,(1) Doesn't directly address life below water.,"(1) The initiative does not impact life below water, as it is focused on digital information security.",(1) No direct impact on life below water.,1,,1,1,(1) No direct impact on life on land.,"(1) Life on land is not directly affected by the initiative, which is about securing legal information.",(1) Doesn't contribute to life on land or biodiversity.,1,,10,1,(1) Supports peace and justice through secure information.,"(10) The initiative strongly supports peace, justice, and strong institutions by ensuring the integrity and transparency of legal information through blockchain technology.",(1) No significant impact on peace or justice.,1,,8,9,(1) Doesn't directly address partnerships for the goals.,(8) The initiative promotes partnerships for the goals by leveraging advanced technology like blockchain to enhance trust and collaboration in legal information management.,(9) Strongly supports partnerships for secure information exchange.

PSTW-2150,262,Swarmchestrate EU project - Parking occupancy magnetometer sensor threshold recalibration,https://www.swarmchestrate.eu/flood-prevention/,"The EU-funded Swarmchestrate project aims to deliver one with the self-organisation of so-called swarms of interdependent units in a dynamic orchestration space. The swarms will be managed by decentralised orchestration agents with blockchain-based trusted solutions, state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms, and privacy-preserving data analytics.  This demonstrator will be based on the FUELICS parking occupancy, battery-operated sensor that offers parking and anti-parking roadside services. The sensor is calibrated at the location of each installation to measure the earth magnetic flux in a 3D ellipsoid space around the sensor. Once this is registered at the edge of the sensorsÃ¢ÂÂ local storage, the device is able to detect the presence of large metallic objects above or in the vicinity of the sensor because their presence distorts the magnetic field. The sensor is able to detect this change and report a parking space occupancy event. However, in practice it is common for the magnetic field of the earth to randomly drift or even completely change which leads to the sensor reporting false positive or negative events and calling for its manual recalibration.  The goal of the demonstrator is to create an application that will combine the magnetic flux data of multiple sensors, and in the case of abnormal behaviour it will trigger the auto-calibration and reconfiguration of the sensors in an automated way. The aim is to develop an application that uses this network to depict changes of the earthÃ¢ÂÂs magnetic field over time at planetary scale, as well as, using smaller localised sensor networks to study possible effects of local phenomena (e.g. an earthquake) at a particular location.

PSTW-2151,263,Swarmchestrate EU project - Digital Twin of Natural Habitat,https://www.swarmchestrate.eu/flood-prevention/,"The EU-funded Swarmchestrate project aims to deliver one with the self-organisation of so-called swarms of interdependent units in a dynamic orchestration space. The swarms will be managed by decentralised orchestration agents with blockchain-based trusted solutions, state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms, and privacy-preserving data analytics. UST has developed advanced metaverse and web3 capabilities. Their research has shown that a deeper connection to virtual environments is made possible with an increased sense of the persistence of personal and collective achievement and by drawing more heavily on the physical world through real-time updates to the virtual. The company has an ambitious goal to create a digital twin of nature. Turning the virtual environment into a compelling, meaningful experience with persistence for each individual user relies on web3, decentralised knowledge and secure identity so that each userÃ¢ÂÂs activity within the twin has persistence for that individual. With a final goal of increasing the TRL of this exciting concept, Swarmchestrate will prepare the ground for full scale digital twins that harness the localised digital resources to inform of real time changes to be made to virtual environments enjoyed by many remote users. The demonstrator will generate novel and very complex challenges generating requirements for each of the components, stretching the creativity of their designers, pushing their developers and expanding the research and exploitation potential of the project.

PSTW-2316,276,Decentralised and Secure Approach to User Authentication,https://blog.iota.org/iota-web3-id-solution-sandbox/,"The Web3 Identification Solution built by the IOTA Foundation with walt.id, IDnow, Bloom Wallet, and HAVN, has been selected to take part in the European Blockchain Sandbox, initiated by the European Commission. Launched in 2023, the European Blockchain Sandbox for innovative DLT use cases is an initiative by the European Commission. Every year, no more than 20 projects are selected to take part. The sandbox provides a controlled environment for testing and validating innovative DLT solutions while engaging closely with regulators from across the EU. The Web3 Identification Solution is a cutting-edge user authentication system designed to meet the demand for reliable identity verification tools in the Web3 space. Developed by a consortium of five experienced operators in the distributed ledger technology and identification industry, the solution offers an easy way to ensure users are identified while ensuring privacy and security.

The Web3 Identification Solution caters to the regulatory needs of Web3 and DeFi projects and enables them to interact seamlessly with verified users while excluding unverified addresses. The userÃ¢ÂÂs identity is verified through several methods, including automated and human-assisted verification, and the resulting ID token is stored in the userÃ¢ÂÂs Web3 wallet. The token can then be used for on-chain interactions in Web3 applications without revealing personal information. The token can later be revoked or revealed by an authorised party, enabling law enforcement agencies to identify users and track any illicit funds on the network.

PSTW-2324,280,Decentralised Autonomous Organisation for freelance work,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/European+Blockchain+Sandbox+announces+the+selected+projects+for+the+second+cohort,"MINOS has been selected to take part in the European Blockchain Sandbox, initiated by the European Commission. MINOS is a platform designed to operate a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) for freelance work powered by its technology provider Kunveno. In traditional organisations, rules are set and enforced by a management hierarchy. In contrast, MINOS defines and enforces rules through blockchain-based code, reducing coordination costs and enabling a new organisational model for freelance work in the Web3. The DLT technology behind MINOS fosters trust and collaboration and allows shared management of funds and rules, facilitating market-style interactions to coordinate operations instead of conventional internal processes.

MINOS is designed as an ""organisation's operating system,"" providing a secure interface for managing underlying resources. The protocol's structure revolves around domains and permissions. Domains, which can represent teams, departments, or projects, help organise the network and contextualise reputation. Permissions, ranging from recovery to administration, control access to different functionalities within MINOS. This modularity
and flexibility in structure enable effective division of labour and resource allocation, tailored to the organisation's needs.The protocol's funding and expenditure mechanisms are designed to manage tokens and finances efficiently. Each domain and expenditure has an associated funding pot, acting as a wallet for specific activities. Expenditures, or payments, are abstract units used to transfer funds within MINOS, with various properties such as recipients and payouts. Once tokens are received, they are under the recipient's control, reflecting the
irreversibility of blockchain transactions. The MINOS internal token is used to distribute reputation and control within the network, aligning incentives among members.

Reputation within MINOS is a critical aspect, representing the value of members' contributions over time. Reputation is earned through labour, arbitration processes, and the initial bootstrapping of the network. It is domain-specific and skill-based, allowing for granular recognition of work. Reputation decays over time to ensure it reflects recent contributions, incentivising continuous participation. The reputation system supports meritocratic decision-making and influences the distribution of rewards within the network.",Across Countries,Spain,ES,European Commission,European

TrrueÃ¢ÂÂs mission is to optimise fundraising for impact investment projects by reducing friction and ensuring regulatory compliance using a range of innovative features, primarily architected on blockchain technology. By providing innovative solutions that are faster, more secure, and more cost effective than traditional fundraising systems, Trrue is helping to unlock the potential of responsible impact investing for ESG-positive projects and investors.

Trrue is committed to the creation of Trrue Chain Ã¢ÂÂ the foundation of an expansive ecosystem built to maintain ethical standards and ensure rigorous regulatory compliance.

The Trrue Chain blockchain implements a governance protocol that ensures that all on-chain data is verified by a network of trusted and reputable players. This provides the benefits of distributed computing without sacrificing scalability of the system, as well as retaining traditional legal relationships for regulatory compliance. The node is built with Polkadot Substrate and Cumulus, enabling interoperability between blockchains so that, unlike other RWA protocols, the Trrue infrastructure can truly bridge traditional financial markets with the entire Web3 landscape.

Trrue is addressing the greenwashing problem, which appears rampant in the financial services sector, while making sure these EU/EEA under development and developed-and-scaling companies with impact solutions get the support they deserve. With a view to upcoming regulations, Trrue has taken a hybrid approach to building new, more sophisticated digital asset tools.

PSTW-2331,287,Hosted Wallets Services for non-crypto-asset / non financial related tokens,https://www.2tokens.org/blog/european-blockchain-sandbox-2nd-cohort-announcement,"2 Tokens has been chosen for European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)'s European Blockchain Sandbox 2nd cohort. The use case involving the 2Tokens consortium, along with Amdax, Celebratix, Custodiex, Metaseum, TDE (OnYourMarks), and CMS, pertains to the unclear regulatory status of hosted wallet services for tokens that are neither financial products nor crypto-assets as defined under MiCAR.

Tokenization, commonly associated with crypto-assets, also has numerous applications beyond financial products and services. Companies like Celebratix, Metaseum, and TDE utilize this technology to provide non-financial and non-crypto-asset tokens, such as concert and museum tickets, proof of attendance tokens, and fan engagement points, in their services. Typically, their clients are unaware that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) powers these offerings. By incorporating wallets into their applications, often through hosted wallets, these companies effectively provide hosted wallet services for tokens unrelated to financial or crypto-assets.

Although the primary service of these parties is related to non-financial or non-crypto-asset tokens, the integrated wallets can technically receive, hold and transfer crypto-assets. Also in the transfer of the tokens they are offering it is very well possible that they need to have cryptocurrency in thosehosted wallets to pay transaction fees. In this way, Celebratix, Metaseum and TDE, could be seen as CASPS while their tokens are not crypto-assets nor financial product related.

This situation could lead to significant regulatory and operational costs, potentially making it unfeasible for these companies and others in the industry to compete with non-blockchain/DLT competitors. Such a scenario poses a substantial threat to all use cases involving non-crypto-asset and non-financial product tokens.

The consortium partners Amdax and Custodiex offer regulated hosted wallet / custodial services. Through this use case, they jointly want to explore if white label hosted wallet services can be offered, e.g. in a light regime, or exemptions for non-crypto-asset tokens are possible so these companies can offer their services level playing field. If not, although products are alike, based on technology, non-crypto-asset companies using tokens are under regulatory oversight but their competitors who use other technologies are not.",Across

Each model will comprise three interrelated layers: (a) the code and protocols that define the governance by the infrastructure; (b) social norms that define the governance of the infrastructure; and (c) economic incentives or disincentives embedded into the platform that determine the overall pay-off structure.

Our multidisciplinary team will contribute to the prototyping of alternative dispute resolution systems, combining on-chain and off-chain tools to ensure some form of due process.

PSTW-2367,294,DELPHI - Coordinated mobility for passengers and freight - Madrid use case,https://delphi-project.eu/,"DELPHI focuses on the strategic dimension of integrating passenger and freight transport in a single system aiming to deliver the enablers -both on technical and governance/ regulatory level, towards a federated network of platforms for multimodal passenger and freight transport, capable of sharing in a seamless and secure manner, cross-sectoral, multi-modal passenger and freight transport data, as well as traffic management systems information. The Madrid Use Case focuses on developing multimodal transport solutions to create a more sustainable approach to last-mile delivery. Currently, the logistics process in Madrid involves delivering goods from DHL warehouses to customers in the cityÃ¢ÂÂs metropolitan center. This system relies heavily on a traditional, siloed approach, with most transportation handled by external players using trucks and vans. This has led to inefficiencies, resulting in slower delivery times, increased congestion, and a greater environmental impact. The DELPHI Use Case seeks to transform this model by creating an integrated logistics network that connects urban and peri-urban areas. For example, parcels will be presorted into specific roller cages at DHL facilities and transported directly to dedicated METRO (subway) depots. These depots will serve as starting points for a streamlined logistics process using the METRO infrastructure.  Final deliveries to customers will depend on factors such as delivery time requirements and the locations of Microhubs. These Microhubs will be strategically placed in specific METRO stations to ensure optimal parcel density and timely delivery. Roller cages will be transferred from the train to the Microhubs, where KOIKI messengers will complete the final delivery either on foot or using cargo bikes. This innovative approach accelerates delivery times, reduces road congestion, and minimizes environmental impact, creating a more financially sustainable and eco-friendly logistics network for
